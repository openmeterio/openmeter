    OpenMeter is a cloud native usage metering service.
    The OpenMeter API allows you to ingest events, query meter usage, and manage resources.
tags:
  - name: Subscriptions
    description: With Subscriptions, you can easily start, cancel, and manage customer subscriptions. For example, provisioning them on a specific plan or assigning custom rate cards.
  - name: Subjects
    description: |-
      ⚠️ __Deprecated__: Subjects as managable entities are being depracated, use customers with subject key usage attribution instead. 

       Subjects are entities that consume resources you wish to meter. These can range from users, servers, and services to devices. The design of subjects is intentionally generic, enabling flexible application across various metering scenarios. Typically, a subject acts as a unique identifier within your system for a user or customer. Meters are aggregating events for each subject.

    description: 'Configure and manage your product plans, pricing tiers, and subscription offerings. '
  - name: Portal
    description: With the Consumer Portal, you can build in-app user-facing dashboards where your users can track their usage in real-time. Subject scoped portal tokens can be generated on your behalf to allow restricted access to the OpenMeter API.
  - name: Notifications
    description: Notifications provide automated triggers when specific entitlement balances and usage thresholds are reached, ensuring that your customers and sales teams are always informed. Notify customers and internal teams when specific conditions are met, like reaching 75%, 100%, and 150% of their monthly usage allowance. [Read more](https://openmeter.io/docs/guides/notifications/overview).
  - name: Meters
    description: Meters specify how to aggregate events for billing and analytics purposes. Meters can be configured with multiple aggregation methods and groupings. Multiple meters can be created for the same event type, enabling flexible metering scenarios.
  - name: Lookup Information
    description: Lookup information for static data like currencies
  - name: Events
    description: Events are used to track usage of your product or service. Events are processed asynchronously by the meters, so they may not be immediately available for querying.
  - name: Entitlements
    description: With Entitlements, you can define and enforce usage limits, implement quota-based pricing, and manage access to features in your application.

        When creating an invoice, the pending line items will be marked as invoiced and the invoice will be created with the total amount of the pending items.

        New pending line items will be created for the period between now() and the next billing cycle's begining date for any metered item.

        Features are either metered or static. A feature is metered if meterSlug is provided at creation.
        For metered features you can pass additional filters that will be applied when calculating feature usage, based on the meter's groupBy fields.
        Only meters with SUM and COUNT aggregation are supported for features.
        Features cannot be updated later, only archived.

      summary: Void grant
      description: |-
        Voiding a grant means it is no longer valid, it doesn't take part in further balance calculations. Voiding a grant does not retroactively take effect, meaning any usage that has already been attributed to the grant will remain, but future usage cannot be burnt down from the grant.
        For example, if you have a single grant for your metered entitlement with an initial amount of 100, and so far 60 usage has been metered, the grant (and the entitlement itself) would have a balance of 40. If you then void that grant, balance becomes 0, but the 60 previous usage will not be affected.

      summary: Create a subject entitlement
      description: |-
        OpenMeter has three types of entitlements: metered, boolean, and static. The type property determines the type of entitlement. The underlying feature has to be compatible with the entitlement type specified in the request (e.g., a metered entitlement needs a feature associated with a meter).

        - Boolean entitlements define static feature access, e.g. "Can use SSO authentication".
        - Static entitlements let you pass along a configuration while granting access, e.g. "Using this feature with X Y settings" (passed in the config).
        - Metered entitlements have many use cases, from setting up usage-based access to implementing complex credit systems.  Example: The customer can use 10000 AI tokens during the usage period of the entitlement.

        A given subject can only have one active (non-deleted) entitlement per featureKey. If you try to create a new entitlement for a featureKey that already has an active entitlement, the request will fail with a 409 error.

        Once an entitlement is created you cannot modify it, only delete it.

        ⚠️ __Deprecated__: Use [`POST /api/v2/customers/{customerIdOrKey}/entitlements`](#tag/entitlements/post/api/v2/customers/{customerIdOrKey}/entitlements) instead.

      summary: Create subject entitlement grant
      description: |-
        Grants define a behavior of granting usage for a metered entitlement. They can have complicated recurrence and rollover rules, thanks to which you can define a wide range of access patterns with a single grant, in most cases you don't have to periodically create new grants. You can only issue grants for active metered entitlements.

        A grant defines a given amount of usage that can be consumed for the entitlement. The grant is in effect between its effective date and its expiration date. Specifying both is mandatory for new grants.

        Grants have a priority setting that determines their order of use. Lower numbers have higher priority, with 0 being the highest priority.

        Grants can have a recurrence setting intended to automate the manual reissuing of grants. For example, a daily recurrence is equal to reissuing that same grant every day (ignoring rollover settings).

        Rollover settings define what happens to the remaining balance of a grant at a reset. Balance_After_Reset = MIN(MaxRolloverAmount, MAX(Balance_Before_Reset, MinRolloverAmount))

        Grants cannot be changed once created, only deleted. This is to ensure that balance is deterministic regardless of when it is queried.

      description: |-
        Deleting an entitlement revokes access to the associated feature. As a single subject can only have one entitlement per featureKey, when "migrating" features you have to delete the old entitlements as well.
        As access and status checks can be historical queries, deleting an entitlement populates the deletedAt timestamp. When queried for a time before that, the entitlement is still considered active, you cannot have retroactive changes to access, which is important for, among other things, auditing.

      description: |-
        Reset marks the start of a new usage period for the entitlement and initiates grant rollover. At the start of a period usage is zerod out and grants are rolled over based on their rollover settings. It would typically be synced with the subjects billing period to enforce usage based on their subscription.

        Usage is automatically reset for metered entitlements based on their usage period, but this endpoint allows to manually reset it at any time. When doing so the period anchor of the entitlement can be changed if needed.

      summary: Create a customer entitlement
      description: |-
        OpenMeter has three types of entitlements: metered, boolean, and static. The type property determines the type of entitlement. The underlying feature has to be compatible with the entitlement type specified in the request (e.g., a metered entitlement needs a feature associated with a meter).

        - Boolean entitlements define static feature access, e.g. "Can use SSO authentication".
        - Static entitlements let you pass along a configuration while granting access, e.g. "Using this feature with X Y settings" (passed in the config).
        - Metered entitlements have many use cases, from setting up usage-based access to implementing complex credit systems.  Example: The customer can use 10000 AI tokens during the usage period of the entitlement.

        A given customer can only have one active (non-deleted) entitlement per featureKey. If you try to create a new entitlement for a featureKey that already has an active entitlement, the request will fail with a 409 error.

        Once an entitlement is created you cannot modify it, only delete it.

        Deleting an entitlement revokes access to the associated feature. As a single customer can only have one entitlement per featureKey, when "migrating" features you have to delete the old entitlements as well.
        As access and status checks can be historical queries, deleting an entitlement populates the deletedAt timestamp. When queried for a time before that, the entitlement is still considered active, you cannot have retroactive changes to access, which is important for, among other things, auditing.

      summary: Create customer entitlement grant
      description: |-
        Grants define a behavior of granting usage for a metered entitlement. They can have complicated recurrence and rollover rules, thanks to which you can define a wide range of access patterns with a single grant, in most cases you don't have to periodically create new grants. You can only issue grants for active metered entitlements.

        A grant defines a given amount of usage that can be consumed for the entitlement. The grant is in effect between its effective date and its expiration date. Specifying both is mandatory for new grants.

        Grants have a priority setting that determines their order of use. Lower numbers have higher priority, with 0 being the highest priority.

        Grants can have a recurrence setting intended to automate the manual reissuing of grants. For example, a daily recurrence is equal to reissuing that same grant every day (ignoring rollover settings).

        Rollover settings define what happens to the remaining balance of a grant at a reset. Balance_After_Reset = MIN(MaxRolloverAmount, MAX(Balance_Before_Reset, MinRolloverAmount))

        Grants cannot be changed once created, only deleted. This is to ensure that balance is deterministic regardless of when it is queried.

      summary: Reset customer entitlement
      description: |-
        Reset marks the start of a new usage period for the entitlement and initiates grant rollover. At the start of a period usage is zerod out and grants are rolled over based on their rollover settings. It would typically be synced with the customers billing period to enforce usage based on their subscription.

        Usage is automatically reset for metered entitlements based on their usage period, but this endpoint allows to manually reset it at any time. When doing so the period anchor of the entitlement can be changed if needed.

        Metered entitlements are useful for many different use cases, from setting up usage based access to implementing complex credit systems.
        Access is determined based on feature usage using a balance calculation (the "usage allowance" provided by the issued grants is "burnt down" by the usage).

        A subject is a unique identifier for a usage attribution by its key.
        Subjects only exist in the concept of metering.
        Subjects are optional to create and work as an enrichment for the subject key like displayName, metadata, etc.
        Subjects are useful when you are reporting usage events with your own database ID but want to enrich the subject with a human-readable name or metadata.
        For most use cases, a subject is equivalent to a customer.

        ⚠️ __Deprecated__: Subjects as managable entities are being depracated, use customers with subject key usage attribution instead.

            SubscriptionItem/RateCard can be identified, it has a reference:

            1. If a Feature is associated with the SubscriptionItem, it is identified by the Feature
            1.1 It can be an ID reference, for an exact version of the Feature (Features can change across versions)
            1.2 It can be a Key reference, which always refers to the latest (active or inactive) version of a Feature

            2. If a Feature is not associated with the SubscriptionItem, it is referenced by the Price

            We say "referenced by the Price" regardless of how a price itself is referenced, it colloquially makes sense to say "paying the same price for the same thing". In practice this should be derived from what's printed on the invoice line-item.

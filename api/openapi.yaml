        Features are either metered or static. A feature is metered if meterSlug is provided at creation.
        For metered features you can pass additional filters that will be applied when calculating feature usage, based on the meter's groupBy fields.
        Only meters with SUM and COUNT aggregation are supported for features.
        Features cannot be updated later, only archived.

        Voiding a grant means it is no longer valid, it doesn't take part in further balance calculations. Voiding a grant does not retroactively take effect, meaning any usage that has already been attributed to the grant will remain, but future usage cannot be burnt down from the grant.
        For example, if you have a single grant for your metered entitlement with an initial amount of 100, and so far 60 usage has been metered, the grant (and the entitlement itself) would have a balance of 40. If you then void that grant, balance becomes 0, but the 60 previous usage will not be affected.

      summary: Create an entitlement
      description: |-
        OpenMeter has three types of entitlements: metered, boolean, and static. The type property determines the type of entitlement. The underlying feature has to be compatible with the entitlement type specified in the request (e.g., a metered entitlement needs a feature associated with a meter).

        - Boolean entitlements define static feature access, e.g. "Can use SSO authentication".
        - Static entitlements let you pass along a configuration while granting access, e.g. "Using this feature with X Y settings" (passed in the config).
        - Metered entitlements have many use cases, from setting up usage-based access to implementing complex credit systems.  Example: The customer can use 10000 AI tokens during the usage period of the entitlement.

        A given subject can only have one active (non-deleted) entitlement per featureKey. If you try to create a new entitlement for a featureKey that already has an active entitlement, the request will fail with a 409 error.

        Once an entitlement is created you cannot modify it, only delete it.

      description: |-
        Grants define a behavior of granting usage for a metered entitlement. They can have complicated recurrence and rollover rules, thanks to which you can define a wide range of access patterns with a single grant, in most cases you don't have to periodically create new grants. You can only issue grants for active metered entitlements.

        A grant defines a given amount of usage that can be consumed for the entitlement. The grant is in effect between its effective date and its expiration date. Specifying both is mandatory for new grants.

        Grants have a priority setting that determines their order of use. Lower numbers have higher priority, with 0 being the highest priority.

        Grants can have a recurrence setting intended to automate the manual reissuing of grants. For example, a daily recurrence is equal to reissuing that same grant every day (ignoring rollover settings).

        Rollover settings define what happens to the remaining balance of a grant at a reset. Balance_After_Reset = MIN(MaxRolloverAmount, MAX(Balance_Before_Reset, MinRolloverAmount))

        Grants cannot be changed once created, only deleted. This is to ensure that balance is deterministic regardless of when it is queried.

      description: |-
        Deleting an entitlement revokes access to the associated feature. As a single subject can only have one entitlement per featureKey, when "migrating" features you have to delete the old entitlements as well.
        As access and status checks can be historical queries, deleting an entitlement populates the deletedAt timestamp. When queried for a time before that, the entitlement is still considered active, you cannot have retroactive changes to access, which is important for, among other things, auditing.

        Reset marks the start of a new usage period for the entitlement and initiates grant rollover. At the start of a period usage is zerod out and grants are rolled over based on their rollover settings. It would typically be synced with the subjects billing period to enforce usage based on their subscription.

        Usage is automatically reset for metered entitlements based on their usage period, but this endpoint allows to manually reset it at any time. When doing so the period anchor of the entitlement can be changed if needed.

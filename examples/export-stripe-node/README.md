# OpenMeter Stripe Example

This OpenMeter example will show how you can report metered usage to Stripe; this is needed if you use Usage-Based Pricing (UBP), where customers pay after their reported consumption.
As Stripe's usage report API has rate limits you can't use it directly for metering; This is where OpenMeter comes to the rescue to report aggregated usage to Stripe.

You can read more about Stripe's Usage-Based Pricing features [here](https://stripe.com/docs/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing).

## Our Example

In this example, we integrate usage reporting with Stripe for an imaginary serverless product called Epsilon which charges their customer after execution duration.
To report usage, Stripe recommends a [periodic usage reporting](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/usage-based#report).
In this example we will report usage when `npm start` is executed. In a real app you want to report usage periodically via cron or workflow management.

## 1. Setting Up Stripe

In this example we will create a metered product and price with a monthly recurring billing period, priced at $0.1 per unit.
Run the setup code in this repo with your [Stripe key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys):

```sh
STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_... npm run setup
```

This will create product, price, customer and subscription entities in your Stripe test account and print out the links to the them:

```text
Stripe product created: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products/prod_xxx
Stripe price created: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/prices/price_xxx
Stripe customer created: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/customers/cus_xxx
Stripe subscription created: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions/sub_xxx
```

## 2. Report Usage

Ensure your OpenMeter runs. Check out the [quickstart guide](/quickstart) to see how to run OpenMeter.
Run the following to report usage to Stripe:

```sh
STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_... npm start
```

You should see the usage reported to Stripe as:

```text
stripe_customer: cus_.., stripe_price: price_.., meter: m1, total_usage: 10.000000, from: 2023-06-07 14:00:00 -0700 PDT, to: 2023-07-07 14:00:00 -0700 PDT
```

If you visit the subscription on the Stripe dashboard, you should see usage reported on it.

## 3. Check out the sample code

Check out the sample code's `app.ts` file in this repo to see how to report usage to Stripe.

> **Note** OpenMeter collects usage in windows. The default window duration is hourly. In this example we round start and end dates to the closest OpenMeter windows.
> For example if a subscription's billing period ends at 1:45 PM, we will only reported at 1 PM so usage occuring after 1PM will slip into the next billing cycle.
> It depends on your use-case what window size makes sense for your application. In OpenMeter you can configure window sizes per meter.

> **Note** In the sample code, we call Stripe's report API with `action=set` We do this to ensure idempotency so that no double reporting can happen.

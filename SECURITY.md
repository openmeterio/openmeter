- [Reporting a vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability)
- [Disclosure policy](#disclosure-policy)

## Reporting a vulnerability

The OpenMeter team and community take all security issues seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our projects.
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

**Report security issues using GitHub's [vulnerability reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).**

_Alternatively, you can send an email to `security@openmeter.io`._

Somebody from the OpenMeter team will acknowledge your report within 48 hours,
and will follow up with a more detailed response after that indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure policy

When the team receives a vulnerability report, they will assign it to a primary handler.
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as quickly as possible.
